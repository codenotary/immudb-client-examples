# immudb Java Examples

These samples use the [official immudb Java client] (`immudb4j`).

[Official immudb Java client]: https://github.com/codenotary/immudb4j

Besides what exists here, you can find additional code snippets and examples in:
- [SDKs API](https://docs.immudb.io/master/develop/reading.html) documentation page
- [immudb4j Unit Tests](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb4j/tree/master/src/test/java/io/codenotary/immudb4j)

<br/>

Please note that you need to have access to an `immudb` server in order to be able to use these examples.<br/>
But that's very easy: just take a look at [running immudb](https://docs.immudb.io/master/running/download.html) to know how to download and run it locally.

`immudb4j` is published at [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.codenotary/immudb4j).

Further details on installing it as a dependency can be found in [immudb4j](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb4j) repo itself.
