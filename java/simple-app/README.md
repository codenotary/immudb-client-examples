# Building and running the sample application

These samples use the [official immudb Java client] (`immudb4j`).

[Official immudb Java client]: https://github.com/codenotary/immudb4j

Please note that you need to have access to an `immudb` server in order to be able to use these examples.<br/>
But that's very easy: just take a look at [running immudb](https://docs.immudb.io/master/running/download.html) to know how to download and run it locally.

`immudb4j` is published at [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.codenotary/immudb4j).

To build the application just run: `./gradlew build`
To run the application just run: `./gradlew run`
